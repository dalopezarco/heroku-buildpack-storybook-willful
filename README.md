# heroku-buildpack-storybook-willful

A Heroku buildpack that builds the static version of our Storybook. This is based off of (https://github.com/Root-App/heroku-buildpack-storybook)[https://github.com/Root-App/heroku-buildpack-storybook], but points to the public directory so that Storybook can be served off of our Rails server.
